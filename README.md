# Bayesian Networks for LifeExpectancy
In this project a **dataset** of the **World Health Organization** is used to study the dependencies between some the variables that could influence the Life Expectancy value in a country, by building a Bayesian Network. In this repository you can find the **project paper**, the **slides** with a **short summary** of the work and the **R code**. <br> <br>
This project was done for the **Bayesian Networks** exam of the MSc in Data Science at the Radboud University of Nijmegen.
