# Bayesian Networks for LifeExpectancy
In this project a **dataset** of the **World Health Organization** is used to study the dependencies between some the variables that could influence the Life Expectancy value in a country, by building a Bayesian Network. In this repository you can find a paper about the project, slides with a short summary of the work and the R code.
