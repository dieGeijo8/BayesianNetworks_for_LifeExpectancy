# Bayesian Networks for LifeExpectancy
In this project a **dataset** of the **World Health Organization** is used to study the dependencies between the variables that could influence the Life Expectancy value in a country. <br>
To do this **R packages for Bayesian Networks** are used. In this repository you can find the **project paper**, the **slides** with a **short summary** of the work and the **R code**. <br>
This project was carried out for the 'Bayesian Networks and Causal Inference' course exam of the Data Science Master at Radboud University of Nijmegen.
