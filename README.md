# BayesianNetworks_for_LifeExpectancy
In this project a *dataset* of the *World Health Organization* is used to study the dependencies between the variables that could influence the Life Expectancy in a country. 
To do this *R packages for Bayesian Networks* are used. In this repository you can find the *project paper* and the *r code*.
