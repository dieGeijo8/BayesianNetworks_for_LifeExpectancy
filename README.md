# BayesianNetworks_for_LifeExpectancy
In this project a **dataset** of the **World Health Organization** is used to study the dependencies between the variables that could influence the Life Expectancy in a country. <br>
To do this **R packages for Bayesian Networks** are used. In this repository you can find the **project paper** and the **r code**.
